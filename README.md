# üöó Car Rental System

## üìù Description

The main goal of our project is to build a simple and user-friendly Car Rental System for a car rental company. This system helps the admin manage cars, customers, and bookings more easily. The admin can add, edit, or delete car details, confirm or cancel customer bookings, and handle any customer issues or feedback. On the other side, customers can sign up, log in, check available cars, and book them directly through the website. It makes the whole process faster and more organized for both the admin and the users, improving the overall experience and making car rentals more efficient.
